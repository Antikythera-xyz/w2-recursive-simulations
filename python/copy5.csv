,Semio-mimetics,,Interior simulations used for cognition and environment interpretation.,"Different entities understand and relate to the world around them through semio-mimetics: internal world models of the external environment. Relevant information is extrapolated to interpret environmental logics, predict outcomes, and create meaning. Internal semio-mimetic models are generated through observation and describe individual cognition. These models include the cellular cognition of xenobots and the AI ‘agents’ trained in artificial worlds.",,,,
,De-chaos model,,Simulations that draw out new legibility from complex systems.,"Models of “de-chaos” take networks of actors and forces whose complexity exceeds individual perception and synthesizes them for new understanding. These models are constructed through quantitative analysis and deploy abstraction, reduction, and simplification to make complex systems legible. Examples include the population-level data analysis deployed for eugenics and cybernetic theories of kinship, as described by Bernard Geoghegan.",,,,
,Phantomatics,,Artificially revealing the un-sensable via sensorial simulations.,"Phantomatics is a term coined by Stanisław Lem in Summa Technologiae to describe the speculative method of making artificially constructed sensations available to an individual's sensorium. The term describes simulations that center the viewpoint and augment the perception of an individual being. Different types of phantomatics includes VR technology and haptics, or NASA’s simulations of off-planet experiences.",,,,
,Simutation,,Simulations translated between different media and disciplines.,"Simutations are models that are translated from one form of media or field of knowledge to another, yielding fresh meaning. In this act of adaptation and mutation, simutations generate productive forms of estrangement from original contexts and reveal new resonances through different means of organizing information. An example of simutation is the way – as described by Ranjodh Singh Dhaliwal – computer architecture simulates the addressing of cities.",,,,
,Hypercasting,,"High-precision simulations of past, present, and future scenarios.","Hypercasting is the act of projecting and detailing probable scenarios of the past, present, and future. Futures predicted by this process can be used to motivate averting or desiring them. Similarly, these projections can be used to narrativize the past. Hypercasting influences behavior in the present and these temporal projections are in turn shaped by newly altered conditions. Though speculation is key to hypercasting, plausibility is its currency; as such, it must be anchored to high-resolution analysis and observation. Future climate models are one such case of hypercasting.",,,,
