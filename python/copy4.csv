,Semio-mimetics,,Simulations based on models of cognition and interpretation.,Semio-mimetics simulate the way different entities understand and relate to the world around them. These models use abstraction to assign logics of signification to different entities and predict their behaviour. Semio-mimetics are based on observation and centre the individual interpretant. An example of the deployment of such models is the creation of ‘agents’ for computational models of behaviour.,,,,
,Hypognostic Synthesis,,Simulations that draw out new legibility from complex systems.,"This type of simulation synthesises networks of forces and actors whose complexity exceeds individual perception. These models rely primarily on quantitative analysis and deploy abstraction, reduction and simplification to make complex systems legible. Examples of Hypognostic Synthesis include climate models and population analysis (as described by Bernard Geoghegan for eugenics and cybernetic theories of kinship).",,,,
,Phantomatics,,Sensorial simulations that artificially instantiate the insensible.,"Phantomatics is a term coined by Stanislaw Lem in his Summa Technologiae to indicate a speculative method connecting an individual's sensorium to artificially induced sensations. The term is useful to describe simulations that centre the viewpoint and perception of the individual human or non-human being. Example of Phantomatics are VR technology and its sensorial counterparts, or NASA’s simulations of off-planet experiences.",,,,
,Simutation,,"Simulations adapted from other media contexts ","Simutations are models which have been translated from one field of knowledge or medium to the other. In an act of forced abstraction, simutations generate productive forms of estrangement from the object of the models and can reveal the affordances and limitations of different means of organising information. An example of simutation is the way – as described by Ranjodh Singh Dhaliwal – computers are modelled after cities.",,,,
,Hypercasting,,"High precision simulations of past, present, and future scenarios.","Hypercasting describes a type of simulation which projects and details likely, future scenarios. Depending on the desirability of each scenario, it’s definition represents an effort to either avoid or move towards it. Hypercasting has the potential to influence behaviour and choices in the present and becomes in turn shaped by these altered conditions. Though speculation is always present, plausibility is the currency of hypercasting. As such, it must be grounded on the highest resolution of analysis and observation. Climate models are an example of hypercasting.",,,,
