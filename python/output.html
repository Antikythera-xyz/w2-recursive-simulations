Hypercasting
<div class="ssherman tile quote"><span>“There's this great irony in that man thought he was designing the world for man, but man actually designed it for machines.”</span></div>
<div class="ssherman tile"><span>A question about Homo Sapiens has been posed all along: to what degree does knowing whether it's us, or the system at large, enable the sufficient conditions for the intentional negative structure to come?</span></div>
<div class="ssherman tile"><span>A platform is a type of system that provides the grounds or basis for future action.</span></div>

<div class="nkhayles tile"><span>Modeling to create the necessary conditions for understanding behavioral patterns of other beings.</span></div>
<div class="nkhayles tile"><span>Cognition is the process by which an organism interprets information within a context and connects it with meaning.</span></div>
<div class="nkhayles tile quote"><span>“Where there is life, there is cognition.”</span></div>
<div class="nkhayles tile"><span>Unicellular organisms have cognition: they are able to move towards food as well as move away from toxins.</span></div>
<div class="nkhayles tile quote"><span>“To have meaning you don't have to have abstract symbols or language such as humans have, but rather biological behavior can be understood as cognition in action.”</span></div>
<div class="nkhayles tile"><span>All life forms have their specific umwelten.</span></div>
<div class="nkhayles tile"><span>Lifeforms perform actions that have meaning to them.</span></div>
<div class="nkhayles tile"><span>Cognitive assemblages are collectivities of human, non-human and computational media through which information, interpretations and meanings circulate.</span></div>
<div class="nkhayles tile"><span>Cells and cellular processes are competent problem-solving agents with agendas.</span></div>
<div class="nkhayles tile"><span>Cells use their cognitive abilities to arrive at new solutions.</span></div>
<div class="bgeoghegan tile"><span>To legitimize the analogy between a computer and a human brain, or to think of language in terms of codes or "cultural codes," comes from human scientists making these suggestions to the engineers.</span></div>
<div class="jparikka tile"><span>Operational images correspond to the list of operations that expand to a different register of epistemic and aesthetic features.</span></div>
<div class="preed tile"><span>The human as a symbol-manipulating species.</span></div>
<div class="acavia tile image"><img src="img/topology.png"><br><span>Computation is a toolkit for navigating continuous spaces, bounded only the expressive limits of language for describing structures.</span></div>
<div class="acavia tile"><span>To realize the world becomes about our ability to create a topological site to identify entities that are said to inhabit our world.</span></div>
<div class="bkonior tile image"><img src="img/solaris.jpg"><br><span>The ocean in "Solaris" remains unknowable—confronting humans with how inadequate and restrictive our own cognition is</span></div>
<div class="bkonior tile"><span>Central in Lem's work is a realization that humans cannot figure or imagine real otherness. Humans are just looking for cognitive patterns already familiar to us rather than something legitimately alien.</span></div>
<div class="bkonior tile quote"><span>“What is the use of an intelligence we can't understand?”</span></div>


De-chaos model
<div class="ssherman tile image"><img src="img/tati.jpg"><br><span>"How is it possible that all of these things came together to enable this – that an infrastructure traversing the globe would enable these self-propelling machines?"</span></div>
<div class="nkhayles tile"><span>Cognition is modular. Each level of cognition builds on its capacities that enable the larger goals of the next level up to emerge. Single-cells know local information about environments but a network of them can integrate signals across distances. They store memories of patterns and compute large-scale outcomes.</span></div>
<div class="bgeoghegan tile"><span>Film, photographs, and transcription protocols that documented tribes in Bali represented new ethnographic writing that was considered "pure, unmediated, objective" as compared to their previous romantic depictions in literature, (authored). This allowed for greater autonomy in how indigenous cultures account for themselves.</span></div>
<div class="mseu tile quote"><span>“There are many ways media can manifest, and it ultimately picks a medium.”</span></div>
<div class="rdhaliwal tile"><span>Addressability emerges through linkages between the symbolic (alphabet, numbers, addresses) and the physical (the material location).</span></div>
<div class="jparikka tile"><span>The planetary's architectural imaginary is a partial, modelled, visualised, bordered, fragmented, multi-scalar entity in which images recursively participate in various kinds of material transformations.</span></div>
<div class="jparikka tile"><span>Operational images are part of a larger system of analysis, identification, tracking, and destruction. Reinforced is the coupling of perception and action, and of images that control, regulate, and amplify how bodies operate.</span></div>

<div class="bkonior tile"><span>There is a "deluded hubris" to assume a simple causality between what we design, what we want to happen, and the actual outcomes we see in the world of our plans. History proves that no matter how controlled our planning is, there are always unintended consequences.</span></div>
<div class="bkonior tile quote"><span>“What if humans are a phase in the history of technology?”</span></div>
<div class="jparikka tile image"><img src="img/maptek.png"><br><span>Synthetic environments are created through operational images and techniques such as dashboards and other screen-interfaces. Operational images are not just images on a screen, their presentation, modifications, and distribution generate a particular image environment.</span></div>
<div class="rdhaliwal tile quote"><span>“The quest to earmark spaces for operations in cities is a continuum with a quest for earmarking orders of subjectivities.”</span></div>


Phantomatics
<div class="ssherman tile"><span>Rather than advertising their cars, Ford was inserting a new socio-technical configuration into everyday life through the cinematic matrix.</span></div>
<div class="bkonior tile"><span>Phantomatics center the perception and experience of the individual human or non-human being.</span></div>
<div class="jparikka tile"><span>Operational imaging enforces an abstraction and alienation through aesthetic constraints, extracting or modifying the sensorium into a form of disembodiment.</span></div>
<div class="jcanales tile quote"><span>“I invite you to join me in this crazy way of thinking about science, in which we take take seriously the coming into being of non-existent entities.”</span></div>
<div class="preed tile quote"><span>“We are creatures with the capacity to create fictitious or artificial worlds, for which Wynter deems us as Homo Narrans or narrative creatures.”</span></div>
<div class="preed tile"><span>We are creatures that can create fictitious narrative worlds.</span></div>

<div class="bkonior tile"><span>Lem’s fiction was a mode of simulating alien or non-human-centric scenarios that probed deeper into existential questions of the human condition.</span></div>
<div class="jparikka tile image"><img src="img/blackhole.png"><br><span>Reconstructed image shows the boundary between light and dark around a black hole, called the event horizon. The image of the black hole is an image reconstructed from data around it, because it in essence, is not there. And this makes apparent the case around operational images which often use data captured to try to construct something that is inherently not enabled in the visual sense into a visual sense.</span></div>


Simutation

<div class="mseu tile quote"><span>“Duplication is key to replication.”</span></div>
<div class="rdhaliwal tile quote"><span>“The computer simulates a city which has implications in how computational processes fundamentally work.”</span></div>
<div class="rdhaliwal tile"><span>When the machine does not have an internal vocabulary of its own, the translation happens from the external world to the internal world of the machine.</span></div>
<div class="rdhaliwal tile"><span>When the machine does not have an internal vocabulary of its own, it pulls from the external world into its internal world.</span></div>
<div class="jparikka tile image"><img src="img/vr-military.jpg"><br><span>Reconstructed images are speculative, yet entirely real. </span></div>
<div class="jparikka tile quote"><span>“What images have become is fleeting components in vastly distributed infrastructures.”</span></div>
<div class="preed tile"><span>The attempt by Jesuit missionaries in China to introduce perspective meant advocating for the convergence of sight with a particular operation of localization inherent to its space of reasons.</span></div>

<div class="jparikka tile"><span>Operational images concern a variety of ways of working with images that are epistemologically important. They emerge as simulations, as models, as operative instruments, while also aesthetically impactful. These images become interfaces that intervene in their own environment in a recursive manner.</span></div>
