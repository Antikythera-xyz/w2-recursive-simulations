            FORECASTING
          </div>
          <div class="categoryDescription"><p>
            Forecasting describes a method of simulation which projects and details likely, future scenarios. Depending on the desirability of each scenario, it’s definition represents an effort to either avoid or move towards it. Forecasting has the potential to influence behaviour and choices in the present and becomes in turn shaped by these altered conditions. Though speculation is always present, plausibility is the currency of forecasting. As such, it must be grounded on the highest resolution of analysis and observation. Climate models are an example of forecasting.</p></div>

            MODELS OF COGNITION
          </div>
          <div class="categoryDescription"><p>
            Models of cognition describe the way different entities understand and relate to the world around them. These models use abstraction to assign intention to different beings and predict their behaviour. Models of cognition are based in observation and analysis and centre the individual. An example of the deployment of such models is the creation of ‘agents’ for computational models of behaviour.</p></div>

              MODELS OF COMPLEXITY
            </div>
            <div class="categoryDescription"><p>
              Models of complexity describe wide and diverse networks of forces and actors that exceed the perception of individuals. These models rely primarily on quantitative analysis and deploy abstraction, reduction and simplification to make complex systems legible to individuals. Examples of Models of Complexity include climate models, as well as population analysis (as described by Bernard Geoghegan for eugenics and kinship cybernetic theories).</p></div>

            <div class="categoryDescription"><p>
                Phantomatics is a term coined by Stanislaw Lem in his <i>Summa Technologiae</i> to indicate a speculative method connecting an individual's sensorium to artificially induced sensations. The term is useful to describe simulations that centre the viewpoint and perception of the individual human or non-human being. Example of Phantomatics are VR technology and its sensorial counterparts, or NASA's simulations of off-planet experiences</p></div>

              SIMUTATION
            </div>
            <div class="categoryDescription"><p>
              Simutations are models which have been translated from one field of knowledge or medium to the other. In an act of forced abstraction, simutations generate productive forms of estrangement from the object of the model. Simutations across media can also reveal the affordances and limitations of different means of organising information. An example of simutation is the way – as described by Ranjodh Singh Dhaliwal – computers are modelled after cities.</p></div>
