              Forecasting describes a method of simulation which projects and details likely, future scenarios.
              Depending on the desirability of each scenario, it’s definition represents an effort to either avoid or
              move towards it. Forecasting has the potential to influence behaviour and choices in the present and
              becomes in turn shaped by these altered conditions. Though speculation is always present, plausibility is
              the currency of forecasting. As such, it must be grounded on the highest resolution of analysis and
              observation. Climate models are an example of forecasting.</span></div>

              Models of cognition describe the way different entities understand and relate to the world around them.
              These models use abstraction to assign intention to different beings and predict their behaviour. Models
              of cognition are based in observation and analysis and centre the individual. An example of the deployment
              of such models is the creation of ‘agents’ for computational models of behaviour.</span></div>

              Models of complexity describe wide and diverse networks of forces and actors that exceed the perception of
              individuals. These models rely primarily on quantitative analysis and deploy abstraction, reduction and
              simplification to make complex systems legible to individuals. Examples of Models of Complexity include
              climate models, as well as population analysis (as described by Bernard Geoghegan for eugenics and kinship
              cybernetic theories).</span></div>

              Phantomatics is a term coined by Stanislaw Lem in his <i>Summa Technologiae</i> to indicate a speculative
              method connecting an individual's sensorium to artificially induced sensations. The term is useful to
              describe simulations that centre the viewpoint and perception of the individual human or non-human being.
              Example of Phantomatics are VR technology and its sensorial counterparts, or NASA's simulations of

              Simutations are models which have been translated from one field of knowledge or medium to the other. In
              an act of forced abstraction, simutations generate productive forms of estrangement from the object of the
              model. Simutations across media can also reveal the affordances and limitations of different means of
              organising information. An example of simutation is the way – as described by Ranjodh Singh Dhaliwal –
              computers are modelled after cities.</span></div>
